# EFI has 2 boot paths. The default is that there is a target file listed in

#
# If no entry in the boot list was bootable (or a removable media is in the
# boot list), EFI falls back to removable media booting which loads a default
# file from /efi/boot/boot.efi.
#
# On U-Boot EFI capable systems we do not have NVRAM because we would have to
# store that on the same flash that Linux may be running on, creating device
# ownership conflicts. So on those systems we instead have to rely on the
# removable boot case.
#
# The easiest heuristic is that on "normal" EFI systems with working NVRAM,
# there is at least one efi variable visible. On systems without working NVRAM,
# we either see no efivars at all (booted via non-EFI entry point) or there is
# no efi variable exposed. Install grub in the removable location there.
